# Readings

What the numbers on the glass are, where each one comes from, and how to
put a different one in any slot.

[← back to the README](../README.md)

## Every slot is a choice

There are no fixed readouts. **Tap any number and a menu unrolls from
it**, listing all thirteen readings with their live values; tap one and
it takes that slot. The reading that was there moves to wherever the new
one came from — a swap, not a shuffle, so nothing you did not touch ever
moves.

The menu is grouped by **instrument**, which is the useful sort: it
answers "what else can this box tell me", and it makes a dead sensor
obvious. A whole group dashed out is a wire to check; one dashed row
among thirteen reads as normal.

It opens on the reading the slot already holds, centred, rather than at
the top — thirteen readings is more than fits, and starting at BOAT SPEED
every time means hunting for where you are before you can go anywhere.
Drag to scroll it; a flick coasts. A drag never chooses anything, however
it ends.

Choices are saved per page (`musSlots` and `dialSlots` in browser
storage) and survive a restart. The two pages keep separate maps — the
dial and the music page are not showing the same things and never were.

## The thirteen

Values are magnetic where a compass is involved, and metric or imperial
follows the depth-unit setting.

### GPS

| Reading | Header | Unit | Signal K path |
|---|---|---|---|
| BOAT SPEED | `SOG` | KT | `navigation.speedOverGround` |
| COURSE | `COG` | compass point | `navigation.courseOverGroundTrue` |

**COURSE** is where the boat is *going*, which is not where it is
pointing — the difference is tide and leeway, and on a windward leg it is
the whole story. True, not magnetic: that is what the GPS puts on the
wire, and relabelling it would be a lie.

### Depth

| Reading | Header | Unit | Signal K path |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEPTH | `DEPTH` | FT / M | `environment.depth.belowKeel`, falling back to `…belowTransducer` |

Below the keel when the sounder is configured with an offset, below the
transducer when it is not. This is the reading the shallow alarm watches.

### Wind

| Reading | Header | Unit | Signal K path |
|---|---|---|---|
| APPARENT WIND | `AWS` | KT | `environment.wind.speedApparent` |
| TRUE WIND SPEED | `TWS` | KT | `environment.wind.speedTrue` |
| WIND ANGLE | `AWA` | — | `environment.wind.angleApparent` |
| TRUE WIND ANGLE | `TWA` | STBD / PORT | `environment.wind.angleTrueWater` |
| WIND DIRECTION | `TWD` | compass point | `environment.wind.directionTrue` |

**WIND DIRECTION** is the one wind number that does not move when the
boat turns, which is what makes a shift a shift rather than a helm error.
The race strip's LIFT / HEADER is computed from it.

**WIND ANGLE** is signed either side of the bow, the way it is called on
deck: forty degrees to starboard is 40, not 320. **TRUE WIND ANGLE** is
unsigned with the side spelled out underneath, because 12 STBD reads the
way it is said where −12 has to be decoded.

### Motion — the 9-axis

| Reading | Header | Unit | Signal K path |
|---|---|---|---|
| HEADING | `HDING` | compass point | `navigation.headingMagnetic`, falling back to `…courseOverGroundTrue` |
| HEEL | `HEEL` | STBD / PORT | `navigation.attitude` → roll |
| PITCH | `PITCH` | BOW UP / BOW DN | `navigation.attitude` → pitch |
| RATE OF TURN | `ROT` | °/MIN | `navigation.rateOfTurn` |

**HEADING** carries its compass point on the unit line — the one thing
three figures do not tell you at a glance. 258 is a number you decode; W
is a direction you already know. Eight points rather than four, because
four are wrong most of the time: 258 is not west, it is west by a bit.

**PITCH** is fore-and-aft trim: crew weight upwind, and how hard she is
burying the bow off it.

**RATE OF TURN** is degrees per *minute*, not per second — a boat turns
at a rate you would otherwise be reading as 0.2. Signed, because a heel
and a swing both reading "12 STBD" would be two cells that look
identical, and the rate is the part you cannot guess.

### Performance

| Reading | Header | Unit | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| VMG | `VMG` | KT | `performance.velocityMadeGood`, or SOG × cos(TWA) |

Not a sensor, and it does not pretend to be one. The Signal K plugin
serves it when it can; the arithmetic is the same number when it cannot.

## Where they can go

**The dial** has five slots.

![The dial](img/dial.png)

| Slot | Where | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `c0` | the big number in the middle, with its unit beside it | BOAT SPEED |
| `c4` | the strip under it — header, value and unit on one line | TRUE WIND SPEED |
| `c1` `c2` `c3` | the row along the bottom | DEPTH · HEEL · VMG |

The middle of the bottom three is set smaller than its neighbours, and
that is geometry rather than preference: the three are 214 px apart and
only the outer two can overflow towards the rim.

**The music page** has three, arranged around the album art.

![The music page](img/music.png)

| Slot | Where | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `a` | above the art | HEADING |
| `p` `s` | port and starboard of it | APPARENT WIND · DEPTH |

## What a reading looks like

Every one is three lines — header, value, unit — on both pages:

```
   AWS          <- what it is
   13.4         <- the number
   KT           <- what the number is in
```

The third line is the unit, unless the reading has a side to report, in
which case it is that: `STBD`, `PORT`, `BOW UP`. Heading and course put
their compass point there. Degree signs are drawn at 0.52 em and lifted
back to the top of the digits, so the ring reads as a unit rather than as
a fourth figure.

The dial's big cell is the exception: its unit sits *beside* the number
rather than under it, measured off the number's own right edge so it
stays against the last digit.

## The race set

Every race number lives round the timer, which is where the start
already was, so the big number keeps the middle of the glass at full
size and the readings below keep their cells through the sequence:

```
          (+)      5:00      (-)
   TGT 121%   (P) PIN +12 (B)   LIFT 12°
   TO LINE 45 M     SOG      BURN +3 S
```

![The dial during a countdown](img/dial-countdown.png)

| Item | What it is | When |
|---|---|---|
| `TGT` | boat speed as a percentage of the polar target for this wind; green at 98 % and up, red under 90 % | always |
| `LIFT` / `HEADER` / `STEADY` | the shift since the wind direction settled: the label says which way, the value how many degrees | always |
| `P` `B` | the two ends of the line; tap each as you pass it | pre-start |
| between them | the line's bias: the favoured end and what it is worth, `PIN +12` | pre-start |
| `TO LINE` | distance to the line, metres or feet with the depth unit; red when you are over | pre-start |
| `BURN` | seconds in hand to the line at this speed; red when you are late; dashes until the clock runs | pre-start |

The bias sits between the P and B rings because they *are* the two
ends: `PIN +12` with the P ring on its left is the whole sentence. It
is up while the clock is idle as well as counting down, since the end
you pick is decided before the sequence, not during it.

The pre-start items fold away at the gun, when TGT and the shift are
what a leg needs. They used to take over the three bottom cells during
the countdown instead — which cost you depth, heel and VMG for the
whole sequence, at the one time you most want the depth.

## When a sensor is not there

A reading with nothing behind it shows `––` on the glass and `—` in the
menu, dimmed. It stays selectable — the sensor may wake up — but it does
not look live. Which instruments are actually feeding is shown by the
four glyphs at the top of the control panel.
